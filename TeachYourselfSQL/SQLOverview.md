## Expressions, Conditions and Operators ~ Chapter 3
An _Expression_ returns a value. Expression types are very broad, covering different data types such as String, Numeric, and Boolean. Basically anything following an SQL clause (Select, From, Where) is an expression. 

If you want to query for a particular item or group of items in your database, you need one or more conditions. _Conditions_ enable you to make selective queries. In their basic form they are composed of a variable, a constant, and a comparison operator. 

_Operators_ are the elements that you use inside of an expression to articulate how you want specified conditions to retrieve data. Operators fall into six groups: arithmetic, comparison, character, logical, set and miscellaneous.

These include plus (+), minus (-), divide (/), multiply (*) and modulo (%) [i.e. modulo returns the integer remainder of a division].
